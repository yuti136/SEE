# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**, a simple and playful Python program that lets you add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! 😎

## Features
- Accepts decimal numbers (not just integers!)
- Calculates:
  - Sum ➕
  - Difference ➖
  - Product ✖️
  - Quotient ➗
- Prints the results with a fun and easy-to-understand output

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. When prompted, enter the first number. Decimals are allowed (e.g., 4.5).
3. Enter the second number.
4. The program will display the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.

## Important Notes

- This program assumes you will not divide by zero. Dividing by zero will cause an error.
- The program converts your input to floats, so you can use decimals.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 13.0
Difference: 7.0
Product: 30.0
Quotient: 3.3333333333333335
```

## Code snippet

```python
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2

print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")
print(f"Product: {product_result}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")
```

Happy calculating! 😄💻
